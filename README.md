# This project is to show C# examples of all SOLID principles.


## What is SOLID? 

 SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion).
 These principles are designed to make software more understandable, easier to maintain and extendable. And it allows us to manage many common software design problems.


## Definition of each SOLID principles:

 S = Single Responsibility Principle - A class should have only one reason to be changed.

O = Open-Closed Principle – A class should be open to extension but closed to modification.

L = Liskov Substitution Principle – You should be able to replace a class with a subclass without the calling code knowing about the change.

I = Interface Segregation Principle – Many specific interfaces are better than a single, all-encompassing interface.

D = Dependency Inversion Principle – Code should depend upon abstractions, not concrete implementations.
